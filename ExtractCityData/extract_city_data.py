        ##### Design choices
        # - When a date in the source database is infinity (respectively
        #   -infinity) the associated semantics is to the end of time
        #   (respecitvely from the begining of time).
        # - When a date in the source database is null we consider that the
        #   associated semantics is "unknown" (or unset) and in turn interpret
        #   it a begining of time (respectively end of time) for
        #   year_of_construction (respectively year_of_demolition).
        # - Note: using infinity/-infinity instead of null to carry the
        #   semantics of "end of/begining of time" instead of null not only
        #   clarifies the situation but also makes the queries simpler and
        #   clearer.
        # - When computing the miminim and maximum dates of the source database
        #   (in order to establish practical time boundaries, think for example
        #   of setting upper and lower bounds to the temporal slider) we drop 
        #   (disregard) dates that are either null or +/-infinity.
        #   In the created materialized view we substitute to those source
        #   values (either null or +/-infinity) the corresponding computed
        #   minimum (respecitvely maximum) to a null or -infinity of a
        #   year_of_construction (respectively to a null or infinity of a
        #   year_of_demolition).
        #   The associated semantics are that before the minimum (known or
        #   finite) date means fromever and after the maximum (know or finite)
        #   means forever. Again, if we consider the temporal slider usage of
        #   such mapped dates the lower time boundary represents the situation
        #   at the origin of time whereas the upper time boundary represents
        #   final version of the city as expressed by the city data.
